# Snowboard Forward Lean Block

Replacement forward lean block for a snowboard binding to replace a worn out and damaged part. Based on the worn out part taken off a pair of Union Bindings.

## Instructions

Print standing up on the flat end at 100% or 70% fill. The teeth will print great without any support this way. Due to the small footprint, print with a large brim.

Recommend abs for strength as this is a mechanical part that will have considerable forces imparted on it on hard heel-side turns, landings, etc. Pla seems to work fine as well, just probably wont last quite as long.
